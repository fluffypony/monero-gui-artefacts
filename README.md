# Monero GUI Artefacts

This is a collection of the original Monero GUI design work done in the middle of 2014. It includes the [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn) mockups, and the original mockup artwork. This was used to create the first QtQuick shell in July 2014, which was all the Monero GUI had for quite a while until development started on it in earnest in January 2016 (I added a license and readme and updated some images in 2015, but that doesn't count as development).
